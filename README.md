# Final-Chess-Repo

This was the third and final iteration of the chess game (assignment 4 of the object oriented software development course).

The Piece class from the second iteration of the chess game was modified to support inclusion with the GUI. 
The GUI was built to develop an understanding of interfaces, abstract classes, the JavaFX event handling pattern and the Observer Pattern.

The chess game may have been complete to the extent of the assignment, but would need to undergo more changes. For example, no logic was made for the case in which the game is in the position of checkmate. 

This program was also missing proper JavaDoc. After becoming a TA for this course, I have realized the importance in having good JavaDoc for all methods.
